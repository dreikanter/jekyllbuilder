# Jekyll websites source list

# This is an example file. Actual sources definition should be
# located at config/sources.yml.

# Each line should contain clone URL for git repository. The presence
# of source repository in this list tells the build server the corresponding
# website is allowed to be cloned and deployed. SSH and HTTPS addresses are
# acceptable.

# Jekyll example with HTTPS source URL and rsync deployment
- url: https://github.com/dreikanter/jekyll-test.git
  build: bundle install && bundle exec jekyll build
  deploy: rsync -avz --delete _site/ admin@api.spybo.at:/var/www/alpha.spybo.at/current

# Octopress example with SSH source URL
- url: git@github.com:dreikanter/octopress-test.git
  build: bundle install && bundle exec rake generate
  deploy: rsync -avz --delete public/ admin@api.spybo.at:/var/www/alpha.spybo.at/current
